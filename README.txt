This repo includes notebooks to download your own corpus of Sanborn image date using the Library of Congress API; extract circular features; and classify circles to identify potential MGP sites using pre-trained machine learning (ML) models. It also includes notebooks to train and evaluate the same ML models using pre-coded training data. 

Here's what you can do:

Run "download_maps.py" to download Sanborn map images for analysis.

Run "find and classify circles" to extract circular features and identify possible MGP sites, using the map data downloaded above. This notebook draws on pre-trained ML models saved under the "ML_training" folder.

Under the "ML_training" folder, you can also find data and notebooks to train and evaluate the set of training models used in the step above.
