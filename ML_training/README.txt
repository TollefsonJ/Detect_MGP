This folder includes model training data as well as saved trained models.

Run "train_models" to recreate the trained models (in "saved_models") using the training data in "training_data". This will recreate and save over the models in "saved_models".

Run "evaluate_models" to produce performance metrics for the trained models (in "saved_models").


To do: train full models using all data; save models; upload models here.
